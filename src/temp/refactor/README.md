This directory contains temporary skeletons for the planned refactor.

Rules
- Do not import these into production pages/components until the refactor step for that area.
- These files are intentionally minimal and typed to avoid compile errors.
- Replace placeholder implementations during the refactor and move them to their final paths.

Cleanup
- Once the refactor lands, remove this directory.
